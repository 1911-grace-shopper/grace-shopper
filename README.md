# Made Tiny

Made Tiny is a mock e-commerce site that sells tiny homes.

This project is deployed on madetiny.herokuapp.com

Boilermaker was added from https://github.com/FullstackAcademy/boilermaker.git

## Start

Running `npm run start-dev` will make great things happen!

If you want to run the server and/or `webpack` separately, you can also
`npm run start-server` and `npm run build-client`.

From there, just follow your bliss.
